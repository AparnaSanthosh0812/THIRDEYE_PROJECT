# THIRDEYE_PROJECT
E-Commerce application that contains voice recognition feature to assist visually impaired customers to help with the purchase. 
When a user open application, it will interact with the user to check whether the user require a blind session, if user acknowledge, THIRDEYE will enable the blind session by disabling the touch option and enabling the voice recognition feature.
So, if the user is a visually impaired, they can easily complete the shopping using this feature, if the user is not, then this option can be disabled manually in the application itself. 
THIRDEYE will allow the user to search products by providing them recommendations through voice and if the user is doing a search it will confirm with the user about the products and its features.
